Minesweeper Roguelike — Version 1 Specification (Gemini Build Doc)

1. High-Level Concept
A hostile, roguelike variant of Minesweeper where:
	•	Number tiles only count mines 
	•	All other special tiles are invisible to number tiles 
	•	The game is intentionally not always solvable 
	•	Players must manage risk, gold, and lives to reach the exit 
The game emphasizes misinformation, greed, and tension rather than perfect logic.

2. Core Game Flow (Critical)
Run Flow
	•	The player starts on Level 1 
	•	The player clears the level by revealing the ❌ X tile 
	•	The player is taken to the Shop 
	•	The player may: 
	•	Buy Shop Tiles 
	•	Buy Relics 
	•	Buy nothing 
	•	Purchases update the player’s gold total 
	•	The player clicks Proceed 
	•	The next level begins 
	•	Purchased tiles and relics activate automatically 
	•	This repeats until: 
	•	The player wins (v1: clears Level 3), or 
	•	The player loses (runs out of lives) 

3. Win & Loss Conditions (Version 1)
Win Condition (v1)
	•	The player wins the run after successfully completing Level 3 
	•	A Win Screen is shown 
Loss Condition
	•	The player loses immediately when their lives reach 0 
	•	A Loss Screen is shown 
	•	The run ends; no shop access 

4. Core Rules & Invariants (Must Always Hold)
	•	Number tiles count only mines 
	•	Shop tiles and Challenge tiles do not affect numbers unless explicitly stated 
	•	Each tile occupies exactly one grid cell 
	•	Revealing the ❌ X tile ends the level immediately 
	•	Mines always cost −1 life 
	•	The player always sees a Board Manifest: 
	•	💣 Total mines 
	•	❌ Total X tiles 
	•	🪙 Total Ore tiles 
	•	🟣 Total Shop tiles 
	•	🟠 Total Challenge tiles 
	•	The game may generate unwinnable boards by design 
	•	All effects must be visible and non-silent
